# Topology-optimizer

This project contains topology optimization of structure with SIMP ,the codes are written by Python and used the FEA solver api provided by ANSYS.<br>

## python environment configuration
This app is developed in python 3.6 and require packages as follows :
* trait 4.6.0
* traitsui 5.1.0
* mayavi 4.5.0
* vtk 7.1.0
* PyQt 4.11 (this is very important ,if you use PyQt 4.12 ,the app will not work)
## usage
*  1. you should get the right ANSYS MAPDL.exe path in your computer to substitude the `self.ansys_path` in `finite_element_analysis.py`
and choose the result path to save ANSYS result files.
*  2. you should edit APDL by your self,and there are some tips:<br>
`①` you should make sure that the path of .db file you resume from is right which should be the same as your ANSYS result files path you set in usage1<br>
`②`the application can only optimize the modal that consist following kind of element:<br>
`3 nodes triangular element` ,`4 nodes quadrangle element `,`4 nodes  tetrahedron element `,`8 nodes hexahedron element`,if your model is generated by workbench you should be careful of this, expecially when your model contain surface load.

## version info
All version information are discribed as follows:

### version 1.0.0
* This is a basic optimization frame.<br>
* The benchmark is a 2D rectangular cantilever , contains two modules: optimization and finite element analysis.The next release will contain data visualization of stress, strain,and displacement.<br>

### version 1.1.0
This version contains postprocessor to visualize the optimization results．<br>
Mainly include:<br>
* Show the stress, strain, and displacement timely.<br>
* Show the convergence curve timely.<br>
* Animate the results and make movie.<br> 
The SDK is Mayavi+traits+traitsUI+tvtk.<br>
  
### version 1.2.0
This version is versatile,it can optimize 2D and 3D structure no matter using what kind of grid to mesh the geometry.<br>
And,this vertion is more much more efficient as I replaced the for loop by vectorizing.

### version 1.3.0
this version used a new algorithm to restrain checkerboard and mesh independence, And no longer computing strain energy in every iteration step ,instead we getting strain energy from ANSYS directly.This improvement can enhance the robust and efficiency of the optimizer.<br>

### version 1.4.0
* For robust ,use the same filter as mentioned in "top99"
* save pictures and make movie by ffmpeg
* transfer topology results formated by vtu to stl format which can be used to 3D printing

## GUI exhibition
The app named as shorthaircat.<br>
Shorthaircat could show convergency curve and displacement, stress ,strain ,density in time.<br>
we choose some GUI figures exhibited here:

## Algorithm，hyperparameters 

* Algorithm <br>
The algorithm is simp method , and the filter is the same with 'top99 lines matlab codes'. The iteration method is OC.<br>
Algorithm we used need some finite analysis data which we all extract from ANSYS <br>
*Including*:
displacement,stress ,strain ,element strain energy , element volume ,element center coordinates ,element's nodes number , each element's adjacent elements which used in filter.<br>

*Objective function*:

where the weight factor Hf is calculated as follows:

* Hyperparameter <br>
There are two kind of hyperparameter in the algorithm:<br>
material properties: Young's module and Poisson rate<br>
* `--Ex`:If the total strain energy is too small ,you can increase Young's module so the algorithm will much more robust
simp methond's hyperparameter : Rmin and move and volume factor<br>
* `--Rmin`:a pretty important hyperparameter which can determine your final results. As mentioned in sigmund's PHD thesis , Rmin is approximately the same as the minimun dimention in the toplogy<br>
* `--move`:If your convergence curve vibrates you could decrease the value of move
* `--volume factor`: acturally your final topolgy is depend on your 'volume factor',and in many situation ,when you set your volume facotr is 0.5 ,but the volume factor will continuously decrease in every iteration ,so a good way to obtain a ideal topology ,you can set the Ex a small value ,and try different volume factor.
